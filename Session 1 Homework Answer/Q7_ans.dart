/*
Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur: ```dart void main()
{ String name = "Alice"; name = 123; print(name); } ```
*/

/*
1- dart can't be written before main function
correct code => void main(){}
2- name variable is assigned to a String value and String data type is used before the variable , it can only hold a String value
*/
