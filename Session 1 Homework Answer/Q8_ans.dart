// What is the difference between the num and double data types in Dart?

/*
double data type is used to declare values as decimal values and will print the value as a decimal number even if it's integer value
example : double number = 4.5 will be printed 4.5 , and double number = 5 will be prited 5.0

num data type is used to declare  and print values as integer or decimal depending on the value 
example : num number = 4.5 will be printed 4.5 , but num number 5 will be printed 5
num is better with changing values between integer and decimal like movie ratings
